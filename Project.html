        <h2>Aim of the Project</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          This project investigates the intersection of technology and financial inclusion in Kenya, focusing on three key questions:
          1.	How does mobile phone ownership correlate with access to digital payment systems?
          2.	What impact does internet access have on financial inclusion, specifically regarding mobile money usage?
          3.	In what ways does urbanicity influence the adoption of digital financial services?
          Using both static and interactive visualizations, the project seeks to illustrate the role of technological advancement as a catalyst for financial inclusion. By analysing disparities across urban and rural regions, the research highlights key challenges and opportunities for enhancing access to financial services. These insights aim to inform policies aimed at reducing inequalities and fostering inclusive growth in Kenya. The project emphasizes accessibility and replicability, making the findings valuable for stakeholders such as policymakers, financial institutions, and researchers.

            <h2>Data Used</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              This project leverages multiple datasets to explore the relationship between technological advancement and financial inclusion in Kenya. The primary sources include:
              1.	Kenya Financial Inclusion Survey (World Bank Microdata): This dataset provides detailed demographic and financial inclusion metrics, such as mobile money usage, access to digital payments, and financial account ownership. It serves as the foundation for analyzing financial behaviors and disparities across different population segments.
              2.	World Bank API Data: This API was used to access dynamic, time-series data on key technological indicators in Kenya, including:
              o	Internet Users (IT.NET.USER.ZS): Tracks the percentage of internet users in Kenya.
              o	Mobile Cellular Subscriptions (IT.CEL.SETS): Measures the total number of mobile phone subscriptions.
              o	Mobile Money Accounts (FX.OWN.TOTL.ZS): Provides insights into the adoption of mobile money accounts, a critical component of financial inclusion.
              The datasets were retrieved and processed using Python, ensuring replicability and automation. Merging these sources allowed for a comprehensive analysis of how technology drives financial inclusion. Data visualization using Altair highlighted trends, disparities, and correlations across urban and rural contexts, providing actionable insights.

            <h2>Challenges and Tools Used</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              The project faced several challenges during data preparation, integration, and analysis, primarily due to the complexities of working with datasets from diverse sources. Key challenges included:
              1.	Data Structure Variability: The datasets obtained from the World Bank API and the Kenya Financial Inclusion Survey had different formats and structures. Time-series data from the API required transformation to match demographic indicators from survey data.
              2.	Missing and Inconsistent Data: Missing values in critical variables such as mobile money account adoption rates and internet usage created gaps in the analysis. Inconsistent recording of urbanicity data across datasets further complicated merging processes.
              3.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Substantial effort was required to ensure accurate alignment between datasets. This included dealing with duplicate entries, harmonizing column names, and addressing non-standardized formats.
              4.	Visualisation Complexity: Designing visualizations that clearly communicated trends while accommodating interactive elements was challenging, especially when comparing urban and rural data trends.
              To overcome these challenges, several tools were employed:
              •	Pandas: For cleaning, preprocessing, and integrating datasets into a unified structure.
              •	Altair: To create static and interactive visualizations that were both insightful and accessible.
              •	World Bank API: For automating data collection, ensuring up-to-date and replicable workflows.
              By addressing these challenges systematically, the project established a replicable framework that supports ongoing analysis of financial inclusion in Kenya

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              The findings reveal that technological advancements are pivotal to enhancing financial inclusion in Kenya:
              1.	Mobile phone ownership exhibits a strong correlation with digital payment adoption, underscoring its role in bridging financial gaps.
              2.	Internet access emerges as a critical factor enabling mobile money usage and expanding financial account accessibility.
              3.	Urbanicity significantly influences financial inclusion, with urban areas showing higher adoption rates of digital payments. However, disparities persist, particularly in rural regions.
              These conclusions emphasise the necessity of expanding technological infrastructure, such as internet coverage and mobile networks, in underserved areas. By addressing these gaps, Kenya can further promote equitable financial access, fostering inclusive economic development. The project's insights invite further exploration into targeted interventions for enhancing financial inclusion in low-access regions.
